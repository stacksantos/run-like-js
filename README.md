# RUN-LIKE JS

I've created this simple app to let myself and others tinker around with Javascript functions.

I found it very useful while solving codewars, brainstorming, and whiteboard coding to have something that will show my results in real time.

I hope others will find it of use as well.

Step 1 :

Create a folder on your desktop (or anywhere easy to access) and call it whatever you want. Or RUN-LIKE-JS if you can't decide.

Step 2 :

Clone the repo into your folder using

git clone https://github.com/stacksantos/run-like-js.git "add a space between" /your/folder/path/to/RUN-LIKE-JS

Step 3 : Open up the folder in your IDE (I use VSCode so I can right click the folder and open with). You can do this with a terminal too by cd'ing into the project folder and typing "code ." (code + space + period).

Step 4 : In your terminal all you have to do is type "npm start" and it will build + start the development server.  Now head to localhost:1234 (or whichever one it specifies) and you have a live Javascript code editor!

Step 5 : Now head to the src folder and you'll see a RUN-LIKE.js file.  That's where you'll tinker to your hearts content.

Happy coding!
